# M2_Led_Dimmer
* In this project we are going to design a Led dimmer by using ATMEGA32A microcontroller. 
* In ATMEGA, we are going to use TIP127 Transistor to build a LED Dimmer.
* Now  in ATMEGA can not take a input of +5V, we are going to use a push buttons.
* In ATmega, for four PWM channels, we have designated four pins. We can only take PWM output on these pins and We are going to use a 8-bit PWM channel here.
* A capacitor is connected to each of the buttons to avoid bouncing. Whenever a button is pressed there will be some noise at the pin.
