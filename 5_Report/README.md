# LED Dimmer
## ABSTRACT
* In this project we are going to design a Led dimmer by using ATMEGA32A microcontroller.
* In ATMEGA, we are going to use TIP127 Transistor to build a LED Dimmer.
* Now in ATMEGA can not take a input of +5V, we are going to use a push buttons.
* In ATmega, for four PWM channels, we have designated four pins. We can only take PWM output on these pins and We are going to use a 8-bit PWM channel here.
* A capacitor is connected to each of the buttons to avoid bouncing. Whenever a button is pressed there will be some noise at the pin.

## COMPONENTS USED
* ATmega32 microcontroller

* AVR-ISP Programmer

* 100uF capacitor,

* 1Watt LED

* TIP127 transistor

* Push Buttons (2 pieces)

## COMPONENTS DESCRIPTION
* ATmega328 is an Advanced Virtual RISC (AVR) microcontroller. It supports 8-bit data processing. ATmega-328 has 32KB internal flash memory. ATmega328 has 1KB Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM).
* TIP127 is a PNP type Darlington pair transistor and it is manufactured for universal drive amplifications and less velocity swapping submissions.
